# Homework 3 - KMeans

The code for Homework 3 is written in Python, so to run the script, use the command:

```bash
$ python kmeans.py
```

And make sure the directories in the zip file are under the **same** path with the source code.

If any other test should be done on arbitrary picture, please add an argument after the command, like this:

```bash
$ python kmeans.py <path-to-the-picture>
```
